    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Authentic foul (ful) <i>mudammas</i> recipe, made with hearty, creamy <i>fava</i> beans and loaded with flavor from ground cumin, fresh herbs, and a zippy lemon garlic sauce with hot peppers! Don't worry, the sauce is not spicy, but it adds just the right kick. I use a shortcut in this quick <i>fava</i> beans recipe. Serve it with warm pita bread and sliced veggies. Or turn it into a big vegan feast with sides like tahini, hummus, and roasted cauliflower! Read through for all the tips.</p>
    <p>Foul mudammas, pronounced "fool mudammas,"  is a popular vegan dish throughout the Middle East and the Levant, but it is actually considered Egypt's national dish.
    </p>
    <p>Along with falafel and koshari, foul mudammas--also known as ful medames--is the daily grub of the Egyptian people. A humble but tasty vegan meal made of fava beans and served for late breakfast, lunch or even dinner.
