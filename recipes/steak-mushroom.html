<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter divided</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons olive oil divided</li>
    <li>2 small yellow onions peeled & cut into rings</li>
    <li>8 ounces button mushrooms cut into quarters</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon dried marjoram</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon dried rosemary</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon pepper</li>
    <li>1.5 pounds rump steak cut into strips (or your preferred cut)</li>
    <li>2 cloves garlic peeled & minced</li>
</ul>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil and 1 tablespoon of the butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
    <li>Add the onions and mushrooms. Cook for 3-4 minutes, continuously stirring to get it nicely brown and the liquid in the mushrooms to dissolve. (Don't leave unattended! The veggies can burn easily with the high heat if you don't watch them.)</li>
    <li>Add the herbs and salt. Give everything a good stir, cook for another minute on medium heat, and then remove from the pan to a bowl. Set aside.</li>
    <li>In the same skillet heat up the remaining oil and another tablespoon of butter and turn the heat to high.</li>
    <li>Cook the steak strips in batches for 1-3 minutes on each side until nicely browned and almost cooked through. Remove from pan. (Don't overcook the meat or it can get tough and chewy. Depending on how thick you cut the steak, the strips can be done very fast.)</li>
    <li>Wipe out the pan with a paper towel or a scraper if needed and add the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter.</li>
    <li>Add the garlic to the butter and cook on medium-low heat for 1-2 minutes until the garlic is fragrant.</li>
    <li>Place the mushrooms, onions, and steak back into the pan. Give it a good stir and serve hot.</li>
</ol>
